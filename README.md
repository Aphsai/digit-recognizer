# Visual Digit Recognition.

The method I used for this project was supervised learning.

I implemented back propagation and stochastic gradient descent without any sort of libraries. 
Doing this in Java instead of Python was probably a misplay, and the fact that I didn't switch 
over obviously proves I'm some sort of masochist.

Naturally, I didn't do this all by myself. 

I had the lucky encounter of reading this wonderful [guide](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) and watching
this quite spectacular youtube [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=1s)

It was naturally quite a bit of a challenge getting through the notation, but through persistent note taking and hair-pulling
frustration during debugging, I managed to reach a pretty decent accuracy rate of ~90%.

My next project will probably something with unsupervised learning, tackling part of speech tagging, I think.
